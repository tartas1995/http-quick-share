# http-quick-share
This is my very first Rust Project. You really shouldn't be using it without checking the code yourself.

# Description
This program was made to quickly share a file in a network. As the name suggests, it is using http and it is supposed to be quick. It is a "terminal" program.

# Usage
```bash
http-quick-share [FILE]
```
To end the program, send SIGINT. (CTRL-C)
